## Overview


### Model overview


The following diagram explains the entities included in this module and the relationship
between them.
![](./doc/image/model-diagram.svg)

## Usage

To apply this Model module, add the following entry to your project definition.
```yaml
project:
  models:
  - group: laplacian
    name: project.domain-model
    version: 1.0.0
```

You can run the following command to see a list of resources affected by the application of this module and their contents.
```console
$ ./script/generate --dry-run

diff --color -r PROJECT_HOME/.NEXT/somewhere/something.md PROJECT_HOME/somewhere/something.md
1,26c1,10
< content: OLD CONTENT
---
> content: NEW CONTENT
```

If there is no problem, execute the following command to reflect the change.
```console
$ ./script/generate

```

### Script List


- [./script/generate.sh](<./scripts/generate.sh>)

  Generates the resources in each directory of `src/` `model/` `template/` in this project.
  The results are reflected in each directory of `dest/` `doc/` `script/`.

  *Generator input files*

  - `src/`
    Stores static resources that are not processed the generator.
    The contents of this directory are copied directly into the `dest/` directory.

  - `model/`
    Stores the static model data files written in *YAML* or *JSON* format used for the generation.

  - `template/`
    This directory contains the template files used for the generation.
    Files with a extension `.hbs` will be handled as templates. All other files are copied as is.

    - `template/dest` `template/doc` `template/scripts`
      Each of these directories contains the template files of the resource to be output
      in the directory `dest/` `doc/` `scripts`.

    - `template/model` `template/template`
      These directories store template files updating the contents of `template/` and `model/` used for the generation.
      If the content of `template/` `model/` is updated as a result of the generation,
      the generation process is executed recursively.
      The changes to `template/` `model/` that occur during the above process are treated as an intermediate state
      and will be lost after the completion of the process.
      Use the *--dry-run* option to check these intermediate files.

  *Generator output files*

  - `dest/`
    Outputs the source files of applications and modules created as the result of
    the generation process.

  - `doc/`
    Outputs the project documentation.

  - `scripts/`
    Outputs various scripts used in development and operation.

- [./script/publish-local.sh](<./scripts/publish-local.sh>)

  After the resources in the project are generated,
  the resources in the `./dest` directory are built as a model module
  and registered in the local repository.

  > , --local-module-repository [VALUE]
  >
  >   The path to the local repository where the built module will be stored.
  >   If the repository does not exist in the specified path, it will be created automatically.
